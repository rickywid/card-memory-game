Card memory is a game where you have to click on a card to see what image is underneath it and try to find the matching image underneath the other cards.

This project is based off of [Card Memory Game](https://github.com/DevJamGroup/Projects-List/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Card-Memory-Game.md) project requirements.
